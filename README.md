# phagelm
Protein Language Model for phage protein sequences.

# Loose Milestone Plan

- Familiarize with large language models (LLMs)
- Curate labeled dataset
    - How to handle hypothetical proteins (?)
- Evaluate phage protein embeddings generated by ESM3
- Visualize embeddings

- Define model architecture
    - ESM3 protein sequence embeddings
    - InterPro signature embeddings
        - Proteins with no interpro result (?)
    - Protein function network + Graph attention network
        - Edges based on sequence similarity? Functional similarity? Embedding cosine similarity? (?)
    - Somehow optimize for phage proteins (?)
        - Train on only/majority phage proteins
        - Known/unknown function?
        - Pre-train on large dataset, fine-tune on smaller, high-quality phage-specific dataset
    - Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict protein function

- Build model
- Train model
- Evaluate model
